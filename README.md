# Scheme-Programming
Scheme is basically a functional programming language.
It is one of the most interesting languages I have ever tried and encourage everyone to use it.

COMMANDSETS
This program contains different functions/methods that can be tested.

CHATBOT
This was a homework from our CS 152 class.
This program initiates a Bot conversation. There are hardcoded replies that the bot chooses from. (No we are not using NLP in this).
